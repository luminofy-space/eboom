This project is created to make a personal finance management platform (PFM). 
The PFM platform is web base, the database is postgres, I also use the Supabase to have the Postgres database, Authentication and the REST API for the database tables. 

The project users are personal and individual people or families or maybe small businesses. 

We have a concept of "Canvas" which is a finance project that someone create and can add people to it. all the user activities will map to a canvas. for example user A has a canvas for the freelancing job financial management, one canvas for the family financial planning and one for the individual financial planning. 

The project features is:
